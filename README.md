# SpatialCorr: Identifying spatially varying correlation 
  
![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/spatialcorr)


## About

SpatialCorr is a set of statistical methods for identifying genes whose correlation structure changes across a spatial transcriptomics sample. Along with a set of statistical tests, SpatialCorr also offers a number of methods for visualizing spatially varying correlation.

For more details regarding the underlying method, see the paper: [(Paper forthcoming)]()

## Installation

To install SpatialCorr using Pip, run the following command:

`pip install spatialcorr`
