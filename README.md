## About

SpatialCorr is a set of statistical methods for identifying genes whose correlation structure changes across a spatial transcriptomics sample. Along with a set of statistical tests, SpatialCorr also offers a number of methods for visualizing spatially varying correlation.

Here is a schematic overview of the analyses performed by SpatialCorr:
